Persistence

Two data structures today:
- Persistent data structures (Sarnak & Tarjan, 1986)

## Persistent data structures
Different classes of persistent DS:
- ephemeral: query & update present
- partial persistence: update present, query past
- full persistence: query & update past

We will focus on **pointer-based models**, which consist of a number of nodes with constant # of fields which contain values or pointers to other nodes.
We will also focus on trees because they're easier.
### Atomic actions that are persistent
- Simple method: "fat nodes" where we record copies of each node at modification timestamps
	- Space: Additional O(1) extra space per modification
	- Time: Additional O(log t) extra time per read where t is the number of "time" (# modifications, wall clock time) that has passed
	- Example: binary search tree
		- Time for lookup is O((log n) * (log t))
		- Space for insert: depending on the BST implementation, if we're re-balancing stuff then there is possibly O(log n) space per update
- Alternative: "path copying"
	- Whenever update a field, create a copy of the updated node + copy all its ancestors as well. This creates an array of roots that we can lookup in O(log t) time.
	- O(log n + log t)

### Sarnak & Tarjan's method
- Let nodes get slightly fat before copying
- Each node has one extra timestamped field
	- Every time we update the node, we put an update in the field recording: what field was changed, timestamp of change
	- Second time we update, we create a copy (with up-to-date information)
		- Then perform the atomic change on the node
		- Empty the extra field
		- Update parent to point to the copy (recursively)
	- Amortized space analysis
		- Potential: number of "live" full nodes (live meaning accessible from the present)
		- Amortized cost of an update:
			- If extra field is empty, O(1) real time and +1 change in potential
			- If extra field is full, O(1) real time and -1 change in potential
				- If we scale constant on potential to cancel out O(1), this operation is free

## Generalizing
To generalize beyond trees, we just need a number of extra fields equal to the maximum indegree of a node (so long as this is bounded above by a constant).

Summary: we have a method of persisting a tree that does O(1) extra space per update

## Application: Planar point location
Division of plane into polygons
- Query point
- Say which polygon it belongs to

Divide plane into vertical slabs at each vertex. Within each slab, the segments are the same & the order of the segments is the same. The number of slabs is O(# of vertices)
- We could construct BSTs for each slab, but this is inefficient
- Keep one **persistent** BST, sliding a vertical line from left to right, adding & removing segments from the BST as the line hits them & leaves them
### Analysis
- The BST size is at most always O(n)
- Every update requires 2 per segment, so O(n) total
- e.g. red-black trees
	- On update: repaint all red/black bits along a path, one rotation
	- Optimization: red/black bits do not need to be persisted
- O(n log n) total space & build space for persistence
	- Reduced to O(n) space if we don't persist red/black trees
- O(log n) to answer queries
