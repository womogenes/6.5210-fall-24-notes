Max flow is a problem in combinatorial optimization
- There are many problems in the real world that can be formulated as max flow
- Great algorithm (provable time bounds are great)
	- Algorithms perform very well (linear time solving in practice)
History
- Used for wartime optimizations / destroying optimizations
- Ford Fulkerson proposed in 1956 specialized algorithms, 1961 book
## Definition
### "Gross flow" definition
A flow is defined on a DIRECTED graph $G$ with source vertex $s$ and sink vertex $t$.
- $G$ has nonnegative capacities $u(e)$ on edges $e$
A flow assigns flow values $g(e)$ to each (directed) edge subject to the following constraints:
- For every vertex $v$, net flow (sum of $g(w, v) - g(v, w)$ for all neighbors $w$) is zero except at the source & sink
- Capacity: $g(e) \le u(e)$ for every edge.

Goal: We want to maximize the flow coming out of $s$.
### Net flow definition
Under this definition, the flow from $v$ to $w$ equals the flow from $w$ to $v$.
### Max flow
Find a feasible (satisfies above constraints) that produces max flow coming out of $s$.
## Recipe for combinatorial optimization
- Understand what feasible solutions look like
- Understand what characterizes an optimum
- Verifying a candidate solution is optimal
	- Gives hints as to improving solutions
- Finding optimum
## 1. What do flows look like?
- A simple flow: a singular path is nonzero, all other edges are zero
- A closed loop of flow satisfies constraints
It turns out that all flows are just combinations of these two types of flows.

**Path decomposition lemma:** Any flow that satisfies conservation can be decomposed as a sum of flow paths & flow cycles.

Proof: We iteratively take out paths and cycles
- Induct on the number of edges with nonzero flow
- Start at $s$. If the out-flow is nonzero, there is an edge coming out of $s$ with nonzero flow. Say the other endpoint of this edge is $v_1$.
- By conservation, there must be another edge with endpoint $v_2$
- Repeat
- If there's still flow at the end, take a node that has exiting flow & repeat

How does this end?
1. Reach the sink -> we have a path. Take out this path with value equal to `min(capacity on path)`. This reduces the number of edges carrying flow by (at least) 1. Now there is at least one new edge with nonzero flow.
2. Read a vertex we've already seen -> cycle. Remove this cycle using the same technique.
We can remove at most $|E|$ paths/cycles.
### Is there a positive feasible flow?
- As long as there is a connection from source to sink with nonzero min capacity, we're good

Suppose yes.
- Path decomposition shows a divide into paths & cycles. The cycles contribute net zero flow from source to sink, so we must have at least one path from $s$ to $t$ of nonzero capacity
Suppose no.
- If there is a path, we can surely just use it. So "exists positive feasible flow" <=> "exists path with nonzero min capacity"

- Consider vertices $S$ reachable from $s$ on positive capacities.
	- Take $t \not\in S$. Then we claim that $S$ defines a **cut** with 0 capacity leaving it.
	- This is known as an $s-t$ cut. The value of this cut is the sum of capacities exiting the cut.
## 2. Max flows
- How do we decide if a flow is maximal?

Consider any  flow $f$, and any $s-t$ cut $(S, T)$. First decompose the path into paths & cycles.
- Every path must cross from the $S$ side to the $T$ side at least once.
- During each exit (path could go in and out), the path uses up some capacity from the $S$ side to the $T$ side.
- The paths don't share this capacity.
The outgoing total capacity of the cut has to be greater than or equal to the value of the flow. (i.e. the flow is bounded by the total capacity of this cut).

Another corollary:
- The net flow crossing an $s-t$ cut is simply equal to the value of the flow. (Proof: intuition)
## 3. Verifying whether flows are maximal
- If there's a path that still has capacity, we can send more flow
	- Is this an if and only if? **NO.** Consider a diamond shape w/ diagonal across the two middle ones, source on left, sink on right, path going up and then down and then to the right.

Define the **residual graph**. defined as a **DIRECTED** graph $u_f(v, w) = u(v, w) - f(u, w)$ and $u_f(w, v) = u(w, v) + f(v, w)$.
- Narrative: We want to represent that one of our options is to remove flow from the edge $(v, w)$. The amount of flow that we can remove is represented by the capacity we have in the opposite direction.
The path along the residual graph is called an **augmenting graph**.

Observe:
- If we have an augmenting path, we can increase the flow value.
- Sending flow on a reverse edge is equivalent to removing flow from the forward edge.

If there is no augmenting path on the residual graph, it has a cut with value 0.
- If there is an edge in the cut with flow, the residual edge has capacity.
- **Ideally**, we use all of the outgoing capacity in the cut and zero of the incoming capacity.
- Net flow across the cut == cut capacity

If there is no augmenting path, there is a flow that is equal to the capacity of some $s-t$ cut. Thus if there is no augmenting path, the flow is maximal.

- Every cut is an upper bound on the flow value, so the **minimum** cut is also an upper bound... thus the max flow is equal to the min cut value.

Thus **max flow == min cut**. This is known as "max flow - min cut duality."
### Some equivalencies
- $f$ is a max flow
- There is no augmenting path in the residual graph
- The value of $|f|$ is the capacity from $S$ to $T$ for some $S-T$ cut.
## 4. Solving max flow
### Augmenting path algorithm
- While the flow is not maximum, find an augmenting path in the residual graph. Augment by this path.
- This is fast (linear in number of nodes) because we can run BFS or DFS on the graph.
	- How many augmenting paths will we find?
		- Suppose all capacities are either 0 or 1. Then the fact that there are $m$ edges means there are at most $m$ paths in the decomposition.
		- We can also argue that there are at most $m$ edges in the min $s-t$ cut.
		- Also, every augmentation increases the flow by 1
		- Conclusion: $m$ augmenting paths suffices
	- In a "simple" graph (no parallel edges), the same arguments show that there are at most $n-1$ augmenting paths

Suppose the capacities are integers upper bounded by some big number $U$.
- Each augmenting path finds some integral value $\ge 1$ to increase the flow by. Therefore $mU$ augmenting paths suffice.
- Interesting lemma: if we have integer capacities, we have an integral max flow.
- Order $O(m^2 U)$ max flow algorithm.
	- It's a "pseudo-polynomial algorithm" because $U$ is exponential in the number of bits we use to represent the capacities.

## Questions
- How do we know that if the residual graph of $f$ cannot be augmented, then $f$ is maximal?
